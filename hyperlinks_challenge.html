                Giordi Fungula , what I have learnt so far
            </h1>
            <p>
                I have learnt so much this far althought I have had coding experience previously.
                We have learnt on the importance of Internet and all the middle-men that are involved in the process.
                I feel that I understand semantics a whole lot better now that I have actually learnt why its important.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel what is important that I cant emphasize enough is good habits; which I have been able to be exposed to.
                For example, when working on a project have a wireframe it helps you look at what you want to design and build and where you want to add features and so on.
                Another reason wireframes are great is they serve as a guidline and you know exactly what needs to be done and who can do it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important technique I learnt was to always break your code into boxes or classes if applicable.
                This helps to maintain the code and the structure of the website.It will help with debugging also as you will most likely know what needs to be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the most important is the process of breaking down your code or projects into simple or able to do stuff.This helps with small problems and huge ones too.
